# Vale Of Mushrooms
Vale Of Mushrooms are Paddo's cogs for Red V3. Red is a multipurpose bot for Discord developed by Twentysix26. You can always find me at the official server for Red. You can also find me at the official cog support server for Red here: https://discord.gg/sm8SbG8

Sadly, making and maintaining these cogs costs time, but no money. They're all made in my spare time when I'm not doing anything else. But if you have PayPal, and you like my cogs, would you kindly think about donating some spare change by following the following link: https://paypal.me/PaddoInWonderland 

I thank you. :)
