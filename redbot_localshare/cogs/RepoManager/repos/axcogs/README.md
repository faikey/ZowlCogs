# Ax-Cogs

A repo with search, retrieval, and utility cogs made for Red Bot.

If you are asking yourself, "What is Red?" or "Who the heck is Red?", then follow this link: [Red - DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot)

##Contact Me

If you need to get ahold of me, I am in the Red Discord Server most of the time. If you don't see me online, drop me a PM or open an issue here. You can PM me on @Axas#7680 if my cog caught your bot on fire. (Both literally and figuratively)

##Credits

Twentysix26 for creating an awesome modular bot!
Everyone in the Red Bot Discord server for guiding me to the proper places so that I can learn by myself and slowly but surely improve (at least I hope I do.)
License page shamelessly copied from Redjumpman, cuz it looked pretty.
