# Overview
The plugins in this repo are exclusively for Red Bot. Most of these cogs are designed around giving your bot a pseudo-gaming experience to help promote your discord community. Please read over the installation instructions and documenatation for more information on how to use these cogs.

# Installation
First make sure you have [Red Bot V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop) installed.

Next add my repo using the following command:  

`[p]repo add jumperplugins https://github.com/Redjumpman/Jumper-Plugins V3`    

> [p] will be your prefix.

Then, you will have to download each cog individually. For example, if you want to download Casino, you would enter the following command:

`>cog install jumperplugins casino`

Make sure that you use the `[p]cog update` command to periodically update my plugins. This will ensure that you are getting the latest bug fixes and features. You may also update a specific cog by typing `[p]cog update casino`.

# Support
If you have an issue with one of my plugins, then create an issue. **DO NOT DM ME ON DISCORD.** I get a ton of DMs and I can't manage to answer all of them. Posting an issue will be the fastest way for me to resolve your problem. If you have questions about a particular cog feel free to talk to me via my [support channel](https://discord.gg/c6HQUb7). I receive notifications for that channel and will respond as soon as I am able. 

If you wish to support this project click on the paypal shield at the top. Thank you so much in advance!! I don't recieve any sort of paypal notifications at the moment, so feel free to send me a DM.

# Credit
jonnyli1125 for allowing me to adapt his jisho plugin into the Jisho Cog.

A special thanks to a few outstanding members of my unofficial test flight: Aikaterna, Claire, ASSASSIN0831, and Yukirin.

Also I want to thank everyone in the Red bot community who uses my plugins. Without you guys I would have never continued making these plugins!
